Running Scripts
===============

Scripts for using lncRNA-BERT for classification and generating embeddings, as
well as for (pre-)training and fine-tuning custom models. For feature-based
classification or more advanced use-cases, users can write their own custom
scripts using the `API <api.html>`_. An example notebook is provided 
`here <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NSsFYvQQbwhH0yf7wEVfjxyvqG-bUrUS?usp=sharing>`_.
